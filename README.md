### Folders Overview

- **`/app`**: Contains all routes and pages of the Next.js application. Each file corresponds to a specific page or route.
- **`/components`**: Contains reusable, presentational components that can be shared across different parts of the application.
- **`/primitives`**: Contains basic UI elements or primitive components such as buttons, inputs, etc., that are used in building more complex components.
- **`/hooks`**: Contains custom React hooks for specific logic or functionality that can be reused across the app.
- **`/interfaces`**: Contains TypeScript interfaces that define types for the app's data models or API responses.
- **`/lib`**: Includes helper functions, utilities, and configuration files like API clients, authentication methods, etc.
- **`/providers`**: Contains context providers for managing global state across the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Next Essential project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

- Store hooks in the `hooks/` folder to make them easily reusable
- Define all interfaces in the `interfaces/` folder
- Store helpers, utilities, and configurations in the `lib/` folder
- Use context and global state management with the `providers/` folder
- Follow the TypeScript and Biome.js linting rules
- Use Husky pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality
